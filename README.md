## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The purpose of the Mood Cloud project is to provide teachers and students a way to enhance their emotional intelligence, commonly referred to as EI or EQ, and better connect interpersonally. Often, many students struggle to express or track their emotional state, making it difficult for teachers to adequately gauge their emotional well-being. Mood Cloud provides a means for students to track their moods overtime, and observe them reflected in a word cloud. Students may also log comments about their emotional state for later reference, helping to gain further insight into their ongoing emotional well-being. Students may also share their moods with their teachers and alert them during times of crisis or despair. Connected teachers receive up-to-date alerts from students who submit critical moods, or alert their teacher directly via a panic/alert button. Additionally, teachers or students may open an instant message alert window to respond to any dire student needs.
